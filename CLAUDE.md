## Project overview

This is an Ansible playbook project for setting up *nix style workstations. These are machines used for every day personal and web development tasks.

## Directives

- Simplicity is key - Ansible can be a real beast. This playbook is not meant to be an enterprise-ready solution. With that said - if there is an enterprise best practice that can be applied without being too overkill, leverage those best practices.
- Prefer defaults - don't specify something that is already reasonably defaulted by Ansible.

## Claude's behavior

Claude is NOT to sign or co-sign commits. The commits in this repository are solely the work of the author.

Do NOT include a "Co-Authored-By" line in any commit message.
